Hi! I'm Wei-Ming Li, a research assistant at the Institute of Neuroscience at Chinese Academic of Science. I'm an enthusiastic learner and always curious and excited to learn something new. I have received stringent education and training on experimental psychology and cognitive neuroscience, and now I am tryinng to develop my ability in the field of computational neuroscience.

I received my M.S. from the Psychology program at National Cheng Kung University, and my B.Eng. in the Hydrology and Water Resources Engineering program at Wuhan University. My prvious research works focused on alpha neurofeedback, visual short memory as well as auditory novalty. 

In my spare time, I like read poem and philosophy books. My favoriate poet is Fernando Pessoa and 
philosopher is Emil Cioran.
